## Description

You are given an array of integers representing the brightness of stars in a galaxy.
Your task is to calculate the average brightness (mean) of all stars and return its integer part (floor value).

Return this value as a single integer.
 


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5
3 10 6 1 8

#### Output
5

#### Explanation


- Sum = 3 + 10 + 6 + 1 + 8 = 28  
- Average = 28 / 5 = 5.6  
- Floor = 5  

### 2

#### Input

4
7 7 7 7

#### Output

7

#### Explanation

- Sum = 28  
- Average = 28 / 4 = 7  
- Floor = 7   

## Input Format  


- First line: integer `n` — the number of stars.  
- Second line: `n` integers `stars[i]` — brightness of each star.  

## Output Format  

- Return a single integer — the floor of the average brightness.   




## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
- -10⁹ ≤ stars[i] ≤ 10⁹
