March With Soldiers

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
You are standing in a march with soldiers of varying elements. Two lists are given:

- The first list contains the marchs you are interested in.

- The second list shows the entire skyline of the city, which also includes the marchs from the first list.

For each march in the first list, you need to find the next taller march that appears to the right of it in the skyline. If no taller march exists, write -1 for that march.

Your job is to help determine the height of the next taller march for each march in the list of interest.

## Examples

## Examples

### 1
#### Input

nums1 = [4, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]

#### Output

[-1, 3, -1]

#### Explanation

For building of height 4, no taller building exists to the right → -1.

For height 1, the next taller building is 3.

For height 2, no taller building exists → -1.

### 2
#### Input

nums1 = [2, 4]
nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

#### Output

[3, -1]

#### Explanation

For height 2, the next taller building is 3.

For height 4, there is no taller building, so the answer is -1.

## Input Format

First line: Integer n1, the size of nums1.

Second line: n1 space-separated integers, representing nums1.

Third line: Integer n2, the size of nums2.

Fourth line: n2 space-separated integers, representing nums2.

nums1 is always a subset of nums2.

## Output Format

Return an array of integers of length n1, where each element represents the next taller building for nums1[i].

If no taller building exists, output -1 for that position.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ 10000

- 0 ≤ nums1[i], nums2[i] ≤ 10^4

- All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique
