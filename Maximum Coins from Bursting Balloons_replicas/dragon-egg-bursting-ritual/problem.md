## Description  

During a dragon ceremony, mystical eggs must be burst without harming the realm’s balance. Each egg gives power based on adjacent eggs. Plan the bursting ritual wisely.

## Examples  

### 1  

#### Input  
4  
3 1 5 8  

#### Output  
167  

#### Explanation  
Order of bursting:  
- Burst balloon 1 → coins = 3×1×5 = 15, remaining [3,5,8]  
- Burst balloon 0 → coins = 1×3×5 = 15, remaining [5,8]  
- Burst balloon 1 → coins = 1×5×8 = 40, remaining [8]  
- Burst balloon 0 → coins = 1×8×1 = 8  

Total = 15 + 15 + 40 + 8 = 78 (but optimal bursting order gives 167).  

### 2  

#### Input  
2  
1 5  

#### Output  
10  

#### Explanation  
Burst balloon 0 → 1×1×5 = 5  
Burst balloon 1 → 1×5×1 = 5  
Total = 10.  

## Input Format  

- The first line contains an integer n — the number of balloons.  
- The second line contains n space-separated integers vals[i] — the value on each balloon.  

## Output Format  

Return a single integer — the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons optimally.  

## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 300  
- 0 ≤ vals[i] ≤ 100
