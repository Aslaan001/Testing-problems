## Slug  
mirror-the-linked-list  

## Difficulty  
Easy  

## Description  

Think of the linked list as a mirror line —  
your task is to **mirror it** so that the sequence is reflected in reverse.  

You are given the head of a singly linked list.  
Return the head of the mirrored (reversed) version.  

## Examples  

### 1  

#### Input  
5  
1 3 5 7 9  

#### Output  
9 7 5 3 1  

#### Explanation  
Reversing produces the mirrored order of nodes.  

### 2  

#### Input  
4  
10 20 30 40  

#### Output  
40 30 20 10  

#### Explanation  
The list is reversed, swapping head and tail positions.  

## Input Format  
- First line: integer n — the number of nodes in the linked list.  
- Second line: n integers representing the data values of each node.  

Note: The nodes are provided as a linked list in order.  

## Output Format  
Return the new head of the reversed linked list, printed from head to tail.  

## Constraints  
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
- 0 ≤ node.val ≤ 1000
