## Description
In a railway wheel vibration timeline, you are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order and a positive integer k.

A subarray of nums is considered `divisible` if the sum of its elements is divisible by k.

Your task is to determine how many distinct divisible subarrays exist in nums.
Two subarrays are distinct if their value sequences differ.


## Examples  

### 1  

#### Input  
3  
1 2 3  
3  

#### Output  
3  

#### Explanation  
The distinct divisible subarrays are:  
[1, 2], [3], and [1, 2, 3].  
Each of these has a sum that is a multiple of 3.  


### 2  

#### Input  
6  
2 2 2 2 2 2  
6  

#### Output  
2  

#### Explanation  
The divisible subarrays are [2, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2].  
For example, [2, 2, 2] has a sum of 6, which is divisible by 6.  
Subarrays with identical sequences are counted only once.  

## Input Format  

- The first line contains an integer n — the number of elements in the array.  
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array elements.  
- The third line contains an integer k — the divisor value.  


## Output Format  

Return a single integer — the number of distinct divisible subarrays in nums.  


## Constraints  

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000  
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9  
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
