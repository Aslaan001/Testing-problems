## Description

In this reimagined scenario, prime of the infinite reflection spiral describes a number that remains unchanged when viewed in reflection. Additionally, the number must satisfy the classical requirement of primality, meaning it is greater than one and has no divisors other than itself and one. Your mission is to find the smallest such value greater than or equal to the given input. A valid answer is always guaranteed within the allowed numerical range.
