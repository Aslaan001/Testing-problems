## Description

A medical imaging system logs signal intensities in nums and may modify one to maximize triple-scan clarity.

You are given an integer array nums.

You are allowed to change exactly one element in the array to any integer within the range [-100000, 100000] (inclusive).

After making this single change, determine the largest possible product of any three distinct elements from the updated array.

Return the maximum product value that can be achieved.


## Examples

### Example 1

Input
3
5 0 9

Output
4500000

Explanation
Replacing 0 with -100000 gives the array [5, -100000, 9].
The product 5 * (-100000) * 9 = -4500000.
Replacing 0 with 100000 gives [5, 100000, 9], producing 5 * 100000 * 9 = 4500000.
The maximum possible product is 4500000.

### Example 2

Input
5
-3 -2 -7 -5 -9

Output
6300000

Explanation
-9 * -7 * 1e5 = 6300000

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array elements.

## Output Format

Return a single integer representing the maximum possible product of any three elements after one allowed replacement.
