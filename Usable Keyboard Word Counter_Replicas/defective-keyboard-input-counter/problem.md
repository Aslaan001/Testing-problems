## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

User input modules sometimes operate under degraded conditions where certain letter keys are
unavailable. To assess usability, a collection of tokens is analyzed to identify which entries
can be fully typed without relying on any broken keys. The total number of such tokens forms the
result of the evaluation.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

hello world  
ad

#### Output

1

#### Explanation

The word `world` cannot be typed because it contains the letter `d`, which is broken.  
Only `hello` can be typed.

### 2

#### Input

leet code  
lt

#### Output

1

#### Explanation

The word `leet` cannot be typed because it contains both `l` and `t`, which are broken.  
The word `code` can be typed successfully.

### 3

#### Input

leet code  
e

#### Output

0

#### Explanation

Both words contain the letter `e`, which is broken, so no word can be typed.

## Input Format

- First line contains a string `text` representing the words to be typed.
- Second line contains a string `brokenLetters` representing the broken keys.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer representing the number of words that can be fully typed.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ length of text ≤ 10000  
- 0 ≤ length of brokenLetters ≤ 26  
- text consists of lowercase words separated by a single space  
- brokenLetters contains distinct lowercase English letters
