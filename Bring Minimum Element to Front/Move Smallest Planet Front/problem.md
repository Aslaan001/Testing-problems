## Description

Astronomers have discovered a line of planets represented by their masses.  
Your task is to bring the `smallest planet` (with the least mass) to the front of the line by swapping it with the first planet.  

If the smallest planet is already at the front, the order remains unchanged.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5
5 3 4 2 1

## Input Format  

- First line: integer `n`.  
- Second line: planet masses.

## Output Format  

- Updated planet order after the swap.
