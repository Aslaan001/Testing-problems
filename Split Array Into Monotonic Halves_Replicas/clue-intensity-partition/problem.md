## Description

Treasure hunters track nums as clue intensities, rising strictly then dropping.

You are given an integer array nums.

You must split it into two non-empty contiguous subarrays:
- left, which must be strictly increasing
- right, which must be strictly decreasing

Your task is to find the minimum possible absolute difference between the sums of left and right.
If no valid split exists, return -1.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3
1 3 2

#### Output
2

#### Explanation
If we split after index 0, left is [1] and right is [3, 2].
Both conditions are satisfied since [1] is increasing and [3, 2] is decreasing.
The sums are 1 and 5, and their absolute difference is 4.

If we split after index 1, left is [1, 3] and right is [2].
Both parts satisfy the required conditions, and the sums are 4 and 2.
The absolute difference is 2.

Among all valid splits, the minimum difference is 2.

### 2

#### Input
4
1 2 4 3

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Splitting after index 1 gives left = [1, 2] and right = [4, 3].
The left part is strictly increasing and the right part is strictly decreasing.
Their sums are 3 and 7, and the difference is 4.

Splitting after index 2 gives left = [1, 2, 4] and right = [3].
Both are valid, and the difference is also 4.

The smallest possible difference is 4.

### 3

#### Input
3
3 1 2

#### Output
-1

#### Explanation
No valid split exists where the left subarray is strictly increasing and the right subarray is strictly decreasing.
Therefore, the output is -1.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing nums.

## Output Format

Return a single integer, the minimum absolute difference or -1 if no valid split exists.
