## Difficulty

Medium

## Description

A compliance checker processes compact signal logs generated by authentication workflows.
Instead of validating single entries, the checker evaluates continuous spans of activity to
identify windows that collectively satisfy all handshake requirements. The total number of     such
windows serves as an indicator of platform correctness and behavioral stability.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

abcabc

#### Output

10

#### Explanation

The valid communication windows are:

- abc  
- abca  
- abcab  
- abcabc  
- bca  
- bcab  
- bcabc  
- cab  
- cabc  
- abc  

Each of these substrings contains all three required signal markers.

### 2

#### Input

aaacb

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The valid communication windows are:

- aaacb  
- aacb  
- acb  

### 3

#### Input

abc

#### Output

1

#### Explanation

Only one contiguous window exists, and it contains all required signals.

## Input Format

- A single string `s` representing the communication signal stream  
- The string consists only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the number of valid communication windows

## Constraints

- 3 ≤ length of `s` ≤ 5 × 10⁴  
- `s[i]` ∈ { `a`, `b`, `c` }

## Time Limit

1 second

## Memory Limit
