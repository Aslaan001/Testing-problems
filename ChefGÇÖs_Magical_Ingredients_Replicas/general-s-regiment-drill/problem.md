## Description
General is preparing a grand regiment drill using a tactical orders tablet. The recipe requires him to consider every possible combination of consecutive formations he has. Each ingredient has a tactical strength, represented by a positive integer.

For every contiguous group of formations, the weakest (minimum) ingredient determines the tactical balance of that group. To complete the regiment drill, General needs to calculate the sum of the tactical balances of all possible groups.

Since the number can grow very large, General only cares about the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Your task is to help General compute this total so that his regiment drill becomes a success.

## Examples


### 1
#### Input
4
3 1 2 4

#### Output
17

#### Explanation

The subarrays are:

[3] → min = 3

[1] → min = 1

[2] → min = 2

[4] → min = 4

[3,1] → min = 1

[1,2] → min = 1

[2,4] → min = 2

[3,1,2] → min = 1

[1,2,4] → min = 1

[3,1,2,4] → min = 1

Sum = 17.

### 2
#### Input
5
11 81 94 43 3

#### Output
444

## Input Format

First line contains an integer n (size of the array).

Second line contains n integers, representing the magical strengths of the ingredients.

## Output Format

Return a single integer — the sum of the minimums of all contiguous subarrays, modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^4

- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 3 × 10^4
