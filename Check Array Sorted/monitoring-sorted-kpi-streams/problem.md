## Title

Monitoring Sorted KPI Streams

## Slug

monitoring-sorted-kpi-streams

## Description

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are often streamed and stored in sorted form to allow efficient
range queries. You are given a batch of KPI values captured sequentially from a monitoring service.
Before storing this batch, the system requires a verification that the values are ordered in non-
decreasing order. Your task is to perform this verification and return the appropriate result.

## Difficulty

Easy

## Examples
### 1

#### Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

#### Output
YES

#### Explanation
The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.


### 2

#### Input
5
5 4 3 2 1

#### Output
NO

#### Explanation
The array is in decreasing order, so it is `not sorted`.

## Input Format
 
- First line contains an integer `n` — the number of elements in the array.  
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the array.

## Output Format

- Return `"YES"` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
- Otherwise, Return `"NO"`.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶
