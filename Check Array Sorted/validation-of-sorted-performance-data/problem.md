## Title

Validation of Sorted Performance Data

## Slug

validation-of-sorted-performance-data

## Description

Performance evaluation tools often rely on sorted datasets to compute cumulative metrics
efficiently. You are provided with a list of integer values representing recorded performance
measurements. Determine whether these values are sorted in non-decreasing order, as required by the
evaluation framework. Your decision influences whether the dataset can be accepted for further
analysis.

## Difficulty

Easy

## Examples
### 1

#### Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

#### Output
YES

#### Explanation
The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.


### 2

#### Input
5
5 4 3 2 1

#### Output
NO

#### Explanation
The array is in decreasing order, so it is `not sorted`.

## Input Format
 
- First line contains an integer `n` — the number of elements in the array.  
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the array.

## Output Format

- Return `"YES"` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
- Otherwise, Return `"NO"`.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶   

## Time Limit

1 second

## Memory Limit
