## Title

Preprocessing Validation for Sorted Inputs

## Slug

preprocessing-validation-for-sorted-inputs

## Description

Data preprocessing stages often include verification steps to ensure structural correctness. You are
given a numeric array that is expected to be sorted in non-decreasing order. Confirm whether this
expectation holds true. A correct assessment ensures the reliability of subsequent preprocessing
operations.

## Difficulty

Easy

## Examples
### 1

#### Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

#### Output
YES

#### Explanation
The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.


### 2

#### Input
5
5 4 3 2 1

#### Output
NO

#### Explanation
The array is in decreasing order, so it is `not sorted`.

## Input Format
 
- First line contains an integer `n` — the number of elements in the array.  
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the array.

## Output Format

- Return `"YES"` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
- Otherwise, Return `"NO"`.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶   

## Time Limit

1 second

## Memory Limit
