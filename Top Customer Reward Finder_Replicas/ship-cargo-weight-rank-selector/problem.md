## Description

Port authorities track cargo weights in nums to find the k-th heaviest shipment.

An e-commerce company keeps a record of all customer spending amounts in an integer array nums,
where each value represents how much a customer has spent in a single transaction.

At the end of the month, the company wants to identify its top spenders for reward distribution.
To do this, management needs to find the k-th highest spending amount among all customers.

Your task is to determine and return the spending amount that ranks exactly k-th
when the array is sorted in descending order.
