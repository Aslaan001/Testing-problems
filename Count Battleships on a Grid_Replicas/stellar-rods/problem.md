## Description
You are given a 2D grid representing a terrain map.  
Each cell contains either:

- 'X' — part of a stellar rods  
- '.' — empty ground  

A stellar rods structure occupies consecutive cells in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically.  
No two stellar rods structures touch each other horizontally or vertically; there is always at least one cell of separation between any two structures.

Your task is to count how many distinct stellar rods structures are present on the map.

Each structure is either:

- 1 × k (horizontal)
- k × 1 (vertical)
