## Description

A mathematician is studying sequences of numbers that exhibit a perfect balance between addition and multiplication.  
In a given array, certain contiguous sections maintain this balance — the `sum of elements` equals their `product`.  

Your task is to count all such contiguous subarrays that satisfy this condition and return the total count.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

4
1 2 3 2

#### Output
5

### 2

#### Input

3
2 2 2

#### Output
5

## Input Format

- First line: integer `n` — the number of elements in the array.  
- Second line: `n` integers representing the elements of the array.

## Output Format

- A single integer — the number of subarrays where the sum equals the product.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁴
