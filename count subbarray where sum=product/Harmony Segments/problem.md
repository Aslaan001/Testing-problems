## Description

In an ancient scroll of numbers, certain continuous sequences resonate in perfect harmony — their `sum` matches their `product`.  
Your mission is to discover how many such harmonious segments exist in the given array.  

Count all contiguous subarrays where the sum of elements equals the product of elements, and return this count.

## Examples

### 1
